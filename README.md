# The-smart-physiotherapist
This project explores the development of a lightweight AI model as a first step toward assisting individuals during physical rehabilitation. Envisioning a future where Artificial
Intelligence is seamlessly integrated into daily life, the proposed application aims to monitor users in real-time during recovery exercises using radar sensors to evaluate movement
quality and provide corrective feedback. While this scenario represents a broader long-term vision, the current work takes an initial step in that direction by focusing on the use of 60 GHz Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars, specifically the SR250Mate and Infineon devices. These radars are well-suited for human motion detection due to their high sensitivity and non-intrusive nature, ensuring both user privacy and comfort. The main goal of this project is to evaluate the capability of these radar systems to distinguish between different body movementsâ€”such as raising an arm or lifting a leg. Performance is measured in terms of classification accuracy and inference time of the AI models. A key constraint of the project is that the final solution must be deployable on low-power, resource-constrained hardware like the Arduino Nano, placing the work within the scope of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML).
